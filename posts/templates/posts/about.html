                Firstly, I am Farren, an actively learning and practicing web developer. I do concentrate on Django projects
                but I am also learning more and more about PHP and front-end frameworks as well. After separating from
                the Air Force I found that I needed to develop skills for what we call the "real world" as many skills
                from the Military did not bleed over. That is when I found Python. I made websites with HTML/CSS and JQuery
                during my younger days but once I found Python, GAME OVER. I was in love. So this blog is going to be following
                me along as I re-learn web development and see where this all takes me.
